Question 1)
Human Player: A player that makes moves based on user input.

Player: Interface for creating different types of players (HumanPlayer, WhateverPlayer, etc.). The interface
defines the playTurn(Board board, Mark mark) method, which is implemented by different player strategies.

HumanPlayer: A player that interacts with the user via the console to make moves. It asks the user for
coordinates and places their mark on the board.

WhateverPlayer: A simple computer player that selects random positions on the board to place its mark.

CleverPlayer A strategic player implementation that combines random and strategic gameplay approaches to
achieve a moderate win rate. This player alternates between two different instances of Player: WhateverPlayer
who implements a basic and random approach, and GeniusPlayer that implements a strategy.

GeniusPlayer A strategic Tic Tac Toe player that makes intelligent moves based on the current board state.
The player follows a priority-based strategy:

1) Win the game if possible by completing a streak
2) Block opponent from winning
3) Make strategic moves (center, corners)
4) Make random moves as a last resort

Question 2)
Interfaces allow for polymorphism and flexibility. notice how tournament and game worked with all types of
players since all the players commit to the Player interface.
